### CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)
**What is CDMA?** üåê: CDMA allows multiple users to share the entire frequency spectrum simultaneously, using unique codes to differentiate between transmissions.
- **How it Works**: All users transmit on the same frequency but use different coded signals.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Code-Based**: Unique codes for each user. üö¶
  - **All-at-Once**: Shares the full frequency band simultaneously. üì°
  - **SIM Cards**: Modern networks may use SIM cards. üì≤

### GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)
**What is GSM?** üåç: GSM uses both frequency division (FDMA) and time division (TDMA) to manage multiple calls.
- **How it Works**: Divides the spectrum into different channels and allocates time slots within those channels.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Frequency and Time Division**: Organized into frequency bands and time slots. ‚è≥
  - **SIM Card Flexibility**: Supports easy switching of phones or carriers with SIM cards. üí≥

### Comparing CDMA and GSM
- **Network Access**:
  - **CDMA**: Less portability between devices and networks.
  - **GSM**: High flexibility with SIM cards for easy switching.
- **Availability**:
  - **CDMA**: Mostly in North America and parts of Asia.
  - **GSM**: Dominant worldwide.
- **Advantages**:
  - **CDMA**: Higher data speeds and better voice quality.
  - **GSM**: Greater device flexibility and easier global roaming.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **CDMA**: Complex infrastructure and limited global reach.
  - **GSM**: Potential for bandwidth congestion.
