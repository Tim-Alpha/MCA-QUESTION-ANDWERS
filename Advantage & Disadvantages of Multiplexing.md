### Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
**Explanation**: Like a multi-lane road where each lane is dedicated to different types of vehicles, FDM allocates different 'lanes' or frequency bands for different data signals to travel without interference.
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple to set up and maintain.
  - Provides a constant and efficient flow of data.
  - Does not require special timing between signals.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Guard bands between channels can waste some capacity.
  - Requires precise tuning of frequency channels.
  - Vulnerable to interference from overlapping frequencies.
- **Applications**:
  - Radio and TV broadcasting.
  - Cable television.
  - Air traffic communication systems.

### Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
**Explanation**: Like taking turns at a stop sign, TDM allows each sender to use the full channel capacity for a brief period in a rotating fashion, enabling almost simultaneous data transmission.
- **Advantages**:
  - Efficiently uses bandwidth.
  - Scalable; additional intervals can be added.
  - Handles high data rates effectively.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires accurate synchronization.
  - Potential wastage of time slots if no data are present.
  - Implementation complexity is higher than FDM.
- **Applications**:
  - Digital signal transmissions (T1, E1 lines).
  - Mobile phone communications.
  - High-speed internet services.

### Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)
**Explanation**: Similar to different colors combining in a prism, WDM uses different light wavelengths in a fiber optic cable to combine multiple data signals for high-speed transmission.
- **Advantages**:
  - Extremely high bandwidth capabilities.
  - Expands capacity without additional cables.
  - Efficiently handles multiple signals simultaneously.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - High technological complexity and cost.
  - Requires advanced equipment for operation.
  - Signals may degrade over long distances without proper equipment.
- **Applications**:
  - Internet backbones.
  - High-speed data transfer services.
  - Long-distance telecommunication networks.
