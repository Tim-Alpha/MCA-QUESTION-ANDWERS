### WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access)
**What is WiMAX?** üåê: WiMAX is a wireless technology designed to provide internet over long distances, much more extensively than Wi-Fi.
- **How it Works**: Operates under the IEEE 802.16 standard, enabling broadband access far beyond traditional Wi-Fi ranges.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Broad Coverage**: Capable of covering large geographic areas, suitable for rural and underserved regions. üì°
  - **High Speeds**: Offers speeds ranging from 30-40 Mbps up to 1 Gbps in later versions. ‚ö°
  - **Flexible Bandwidth**: Bandwidth dynamically adjusts between 2 GHz and 11 GHz based on demand. üîÑ

### Cellular Network Concept
**What is a Cellular Network?** üì°: A network structure that divides a service area into multiple cells, each served by a base station.
- **How it Operates**: Each cell ensures that mobile devices within its area maintain strong signal and connectivity as users move from one cell to another.
- **Diagram Explanation**:
  - **Cell Coverage**: A1, A2, A3,... represent different cells covered by their respective base stations.
  - **Seamless Transition**: Mobile devices automatically switch to the best base station without interruption as they move between cells. üîÅ
