### What is Multiplexing?
Multiplexing is like a busy highway where different lanes are used by different vehicles to reach their destination quickly without getting stuck in traffic. It combines multiple signals over a single communication channel so they can share the same path without interfering with each other.
- **Points**:
  - Combines multiple signals.
  - Uses a single channel.
  - Efficient use of pathways.

### Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
Think of FDM like different radio stations operating at different frequencies; each station uses a specific frequency band so they don't interfere with each other. This way, you can choose to listen to any radio station clearly without disturbances.
- **Points**:
  - Multiple signals at different frequencies.
  - Signals are spaced apart to avoid interference.
  - Used in radio and TV broadcasting.

### Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
TDM works like taking turns in conversation. Each sender gets a specific time slot to send their data. Just as people wait for their turn to speak, each data stream waits for its turn to use the channel.
- **Points**:
  - Data sent in specific time slots.
  - Efficient and orderly use of the channel.
  - Commonly used in digital communication systems.

### Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)
WDM is used in fiber optics just like using different colors of light (wavelengths) to send data over a single optical fiber. Each color carries different data streams, allowing a lot of information to be sent simultaneously.
- **Points**:
  - Uses different wavelengths of light.
  - Simultaneous data transmission.
  - Ideal for high-speed data transfer in telecommunications.
