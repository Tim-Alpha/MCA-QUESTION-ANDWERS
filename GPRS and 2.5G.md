### GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)
**What is GPRS?** 🌐: An enhancement to GSM that allows for efficient data transmission over mobile networks by packet-switching.
- **How it Works**: Transmits data in packets, optimizing network use and allowing devices to remain continuously online.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Packet-Switched**: Data sent and received in packets. 📦
  - **Always Online**: Keeps devices connected to the internet. 🌍
  - **Flexible Data Rates**: Offers speeds from 7 Kbps to 14 Kbps. ⏩

### Features of GPRS
- **Packet-Based Network**: Suited for emails, web browsing, and non-real-time data.
- **Channel Sharing**: Multiple users share the same channel, enhancing capacity.
- **Versatile Services**: Beyond voice, supports SMS, MMS, and internet access.

- **Messaging and Broadcasting**: Improved SMS, MMS, and instant messaging.
- **Mobile Internet**: Access through services like WAP.
- **Communication Services**: Push-to-talk and point-to-multipoint services.

### Comparing GPRS (2.5G) to GSM
- **Data Speeds**: Faster data transmission than GSM.
- **Connectivity**: Continuous internet connection, unlike the on-demand GSM.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Data usage is charged based on amount, not time.
