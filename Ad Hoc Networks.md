# Ad Hoc Networks Overview üåê

## Introduction to Ad Hoc Networks

An ad hoc network is a type of network where nodes can directly connect and communicate without the need for a central base station or server. These networks are dynamic, with each node capable of forwarding data to other nodes.

## Key Features of Ad Hoc Networks

- **Self-configuring**: Nodes automatically establish and maintain network connections.
- **Temporary Networks**: Ideal for situations where a quick, temporary communication setup is required.
- **Flexible and Mobile**: Supports mobile users and adapts to changes in network topology as nodes move.

## Advantages of Ad Hoc Networks

- **Rapid Deployment**: Can be quickly set up with minimal infrastructure.
- **Flexibility**: Adapts to various environments and requirements, supporting a range of applications.

## Disadvantages of Ad Hoc Networks

- **Security Concerns**: Susceptible to security threats due to the lack of centralized control.
- **Performance Limitations**: Performance may decline as the number of nodes increases or if nodes are highly mobile.
- **Range Restrictions**: Typically effective within a limited range, around 100 meters.

## Typical Applications

- **Emergency Services**: For creating communication networks in disaster areas where infrastructure is damaged.
- **Temporary Meetings and Gatherings**: Useful in conferences or outdoor events for sharing data and resources.

## Network Diagram Explanation

The network diagram shows direct communication between various types of nodes (sensor, device, mobile) through base stations acting as gateways, highlighting the decentralized nature of ad hoc networks.

### Simplified Network Structure Diagram

```
[Sensor Node] -- [Device Node] -- [Mobile Node]
       \             |              //
        \           |            //
         [Base Station A] -- [Base Station B]
```

This structure illustrates how nodes within an ad hoc network can connect in different configurations to suit specific needs and environments.
